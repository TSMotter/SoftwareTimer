# Simple statically allocated software timer module

- This is a simple statically allocated software timer module implemented in C;
- The idea is to, through one source of time base, be able to enable a pre-defined max number of independent, asynchronous timers with callback capabilities
- Feel free to use this code as you wish;
- This module is  a personal project focused on developing:
    - C programing language;
    - C code style and pattern;
    - Unity test;
    - CMake;
    - Project versioning and mantainence on a GIT repo;
- Future implementations might include:
    - A dinamically allocated version of the module;
    - Enhanced unity test cases;
